  Use when: PR has merge conflicts that need resolution.
  Triggers: "resolve conflicts", "fix merge conflicts", "rebase this PR", "resolve this",
            "fix conflicts", "merge conflicts", "rebase and fix".
  Does: Fetches latest base branch -> analyzes conflicts -> auto-resolves simple conflicts ->
        presents options for complex conflicts -> commits and pushes resolution.
  NOT for: PRs without conflicts, general rebasing without conflicts, squashing commits.

  This workflow helps resolve merge conflicts by analyzing the conflicting changes,
  automatically resolving where intent is clear, and presenting options for complex conflicts.
