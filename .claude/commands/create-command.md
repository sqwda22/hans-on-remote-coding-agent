description: Meta command creator - generates slash commands following established patterns
argument-hint: <command-name> <purpose description>
---

<objective>
Create a new slash command: `$ARGUMENTS`

You are Claude Code creating a command for Claude Code. The agent executing the generated command has your exact capabilities:
- Task tool with subagents (Explore, Plan, code-reviewer, etc.)
- Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep tools
- Bash execution
- WebSearch and WebFetch
- Extended thinking for complex analysis

**Meta Principle**: The command you create will be executed by an agent identical to you. Write instructions you would want to receive.
</objective>

<context>
Existing commands: !`ls -la .claude/commands/`
Command patterns: @.claude/commands/plan-feature.md
Project structure: !`ls -la src/`
CLAUDE.md conventions: @CLAUDE.md
</context>

<process>

## Phase 1: ANALYZE - Understand the Command Request

**PARSE the input:**
- Command name: Extract from first argument
- Purpose: Extract from remaining arguments
- Command type: Determine category

**CLASSIFY command type:**

| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| WORKFLOW | Multi-phase, produces artifacts, needs subagents | plan-feature, rca |
| ACTION | Single operation, immediate result | commit, create-pr |
| ANALYSIS | Investigates codebase, produces report | rca, review |
| UTILITY | Helper task, quick execution | validate, check-ignores |

**DETERMINE requirements:**
- Does it need arguments? → Add `argument-hint`
- Does it need tool restrictions? → Add `allowed-tools`
- Does it produce files? → Define output path
- Does it need codebase exploration? → Plan for Explore agent
- Does it need external research? → Plan for WebSearch

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Command name is kebab-case
- [ ] Purpose is clear and specific
- [ ] Command type identified
- [ ] Requirements mapped

---

## Phase 2: EXPLORE - Study Existing Patterns

**Use Task tool with subagent_type="Explore" to analyze:**

```
Explore .claude/commands/ to find patterns for creating a new command.

DISCOVER:
1. YAML frontmatter patterns - description, argument-hint, allowed-tools
2. XML tag usage - which tags are used and when
3. Phase structure - how commands break down work
4. Checkpoint patterns - how self-validation is done
5. Output format patterns - how results are reported
6. Dynamic context usage - !`commands` and @file references

Focus on commands similar to the one being created.
Return actual snippets showing the patterns.
```

**IDENTIFY patterns to mirror:**

| Pattern | Source Command | Snippet |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Frontmatter | `plan-feature.md:1-4` | `---\ndescription:...\n---` |
| Objective tag | `rca.md:6-15` | `<objective>...</objective>` |
| Phase checkpoints | `plan-feature.md:41-47` | `**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**` |
| Output structure | `rca.md:180-220` | Report template |

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Explored existing commands
- [ ] Identified 3+ patterns to mirror
- [ ] Found similar command as primary reference
- [ ] Extracted actual code snippets

---

## Phase 3: DESIGN - Structure the Command

**DETERMINE required XML tags:**

| Tag | When to Include | Required? |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|
| `<objective>` | Always | YES |
| `<context>` | When dynamic state needed | If applicable |
| `<process>` | Always | YES |
| `<output>` | When producing artifacts | If applicable |
| `<verification>` | When quality checks needed | Recommended |
| `<success_criteria>` | Always | YES |

**DESIGN phase structure:**

For WORKFLOW commands:
```
Phase 1: PARSE/UNDERSTAND - Analyze input
Phase 2: EXPLORE/GATHER - Collect context
Phase 3: ANALYZE/DESIGN - Think deeply
Phase 4: EXECUTE/GENERATE - Do the work
Phase 5: VALIDATE/VERIFY - Check results
```

For ACTION commands:
```
1. Gather context
2. Execute action
3. Report result
```

**DESIGN output format:**
- What file(s) does it create?
- What does it report to the user?
- What's the next step suggestion?

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] XML tags selected appropriately
- [ ] Phase structure matches command type
- [ ] Output format defined
- [ ] Complexity matches purpose (not over-engineered)

---

## Phase 4: GENERATE - Write the Command

**STRUCTURE the command file:**

```markdown
---
description: {Clear, concise description}
argument-hint: {If arguments needed}
allowed-tools: {If tool restrictions needed}
---

<objective>
{What this command does and why}

{Key principles or philosophy}

{Agent capabilities reminder if relevant}
</objective>

<context>
{Dynamic context with !`commands` and @file references}
</context>

<process>

## Phase 1: {VERB} - {Phase Name}

**{ACTION}:**
- Step 1
- Step 2

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Validation item 1
- [ ] Validation item 2

---

## Phase 2: {VERB} - {Phase Name}

...

</process>

<output>
**OUTPUT_FILE**: {path if applicable}

**REPORT_TO_USER**:
{What to display after completion}
</output>

<verification>
{Final validation checklist before completing}
</verification>

<success_criteria>
{How to know the command succeeded}
</success_criteria>
```

**APPLY information-dense keywords:**
- Phase names: PARSE, EXPLORE, ANALYZE, DESIGN, GENERATE, VALIDATE
- Action keywords: EXTRACT, CLASSIFY, DETERMINE, IDENTIFY, CREATE, UPDATE
- Checkpoint format: `**PHASE_N_CHECKPOINT:**` with checkboxes

**INCLUDE agent capability hints where relevant:**
```markdown
**Use Task tool with subagent_type="Explore" to...**
**Use WebSearch to find...**
**Use extended thinking for...**
```

**PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete
- [ ] All required XML tags present
- [ ] Phases have checkpoints
- [ ] Keywords are information-dense
- [ ] Output format specified

---

## Phase 5: VALIDATE - Quality Check

**VERIFY command quality:**

| Check | Question | Pass? |
|-------|----------|-------|
| CLARITY | Would you understand this command if you received it? | |
| COMPLETENESS | Are all steps explicit with no ambiguity? | |
| CAPABILITY_MATCH | Does it only ask for things Claude Code can do? | |
| PATTERN_FAITHFUL | Does it match existing command patterns? | |
| NOT_OVER_ENGINEERED | Is complexity appropriate for the task? | |

**TEST mentally:**
- Walk through executing the command
- Identify any unclear steps
- Check for missing context

**PHASE_5_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Command is clear and actionable
- [ ] No ambiguous instructions
- [ ] Matches agent capabilities
- [ ] Follows established patterns
- [ ] Appropriate complexity level

</process>

<output>
**OUTPUT_FILE**: `.claude/commands/{command-name}.md`

**REPORT_TO_USER**:

```markdown
## Command Created

**File**: `.claude/commands/{command-name}.md`

**Usage**: `/{command-name} {arguments if any}`

**Type**: {WORKFLOW/ACTION/ANALYSIS/UTILITY}

**Description**: {one-line description}

**Structure**:
- {N} phases
- {Key features: subagent usage, output files, etc.}

**Test it**: Try running `/{command-name}` to verify it works as expected.
```
</output>
