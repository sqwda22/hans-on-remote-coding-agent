# Documentation Review

Review the document at `$ARGUMENTS` for clarity, consistency, and simplicity.

**DO NOT make any edits yourself** - only report findings.

## Review Focus

### 1. Clarity & Readability
- Are there sections that are confusingly worded or hard to understand?
- Are there redundant explanations that could be consolidated?
- Is the document structure logical and easy to navigate?
- Are there unnecessary complications in the explanations?

### 2. Consistency
- Do the code snippets match the described behavior?
- Are terms used consistently throughout (e.g., same concept called different names)?
- Do numbers/values match across sections (e.g., limits, timeframes)?
- Are behaviors described consistently across different sections?

### 3. Simplicity
- Are there over-engineered solutions described that could be simpler?
- Are there unnecessary abstractions or complexity?
- Could any diagrams or tables be simplified without losing meaning?
- Are there sections that explain obvious things unnecessarily?

### 4. Completeness
- Are there gaps in the implementation details?
- Are edge cases addressed?
- Is there enough detail for someone to implement from this doc?

## Your Deliverable

Provide a structured report with:

1. **Summary**: Overall assessment (1-2 sentences)

2. **Issues Found**: Specific problems with location (section/line reference)
   - Categorize as Critical, Moderate, or Minor

3. **Suggestions**: Concrete improvements (but don't make the edits)

4. **Questions**: Anything unclear that needs clarification from the author

## Guidelines

- Read the ENTIRE document carefully
- DO NOT edit the file directly
- Only report findings
- Be constructive and specific
- Focus on making the document better for future readers/implementers
- Prioritize issues that would cause confusion or implementation problems
